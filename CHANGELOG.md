# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Set email one-time codes and Google OAuth as the only authentication methods in setup guidance, with passwords disabled in WorkOS. Clarify the starter UX and distinguish local settings from verified provider setup.
- Require independent WorkOS/Google credentials for every generated app and carry the authentication policy into exported instructions.
- Add English privacy, terms, and legal-notice pages for CompanyNerve using company-published operator details and the reused Stripe profile postcode, without independent registry validation. Reset legal identity/contact on export and keep CompanyNerve's terms out of generated product navigation.

- Export the website and application together using shared branding, auth, billing, and dashboard code.
- Hide paid checkout until the backend billing configuration is complete.
- Add canonical/structured metadata, preview noindex, Search Console and production launch guides, and two focused skills.
- Keep Node type major upgrades aligned with the chosen runtime.

- Select Cobalt workshop for CompanyNerve and identify it in the gallery. Keep all five recipes for exported products.
- Upgrade to TypeScript 7.0.2, pnpm 12.3.4 and current compatible stable dependencies. See `docs/upgrading.md` for versions and compiler compatibility.

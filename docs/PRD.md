# Product requirements

Mode: reference. Product: VibeScroller. Release: V1. Specification: 1.0.0.

## Product purpose

VibeScroller helps a person apply useful information faster than the person can watch and save it. A user shares content, sees what it says, sees whether it matters to a selected project, and chooses whether to implement a supported change.

The product is a mobile-friendly web application. The dashboard must make the connection between a source and a shipped change visible. It must also show that some sources were unhelpful, unsupported, duplicated, already implemented, or not yet reviewed.

The public site uses the motto "Make scrolling productive." It does not promise income, guaranteed productivity, or autonomous business creation in V1.

## Users and boundaries

The first audience is adult individual developers and founders. English is the initial interface and default source language. The owner approved individual and business checkout in Stripe Managed Payments' verified tax-covered markets on October 3, 2026; direct billing retains its separately reviewed country policy. Users can create multiple business profiles and select the repositories each profile owns. Businesses may buy the same Starter or Pro service; additional custom scope requires a separate agreement. The application must not advertise unbuilt enterprise features.

The founder's one-to-five daily English videos provide a starting workload. The service must use quotas and durable jobs rather than assuming every customer has that workload. The founder's laptop is a benchmark device, not a hosting dependency for paying customers.

V1 is public-source under MIT for authored code. Supported independent self-hosting is deferred. A managed paid deployment is the first distribution target.

## Primary journey

A user signs in, creates a workspace, connects GitHub, selects repositories, and reviews the generated business profiles. The user can also use the library before connecting GitHub.

The user shares a URL through the web inbox, the Android share sheet where supported, or Telegram. Uploads and bulk link imports provide a fallback. VibeScroller checks whether it can lawfully and technically access the media. An unavailable source shows an actionable failure, not an invented summary.

The processing pipeline extracts a transcript and selected timestamped frames. It stores a short summary and distinct main points with evidence. It groups duplicates and evaluates plausible project matches. A project card explains the current implementation, the proposed improvement, the evidence, expected benefit as a hypothesis, risks, and reasons to reject it.

The user can reject, defer, refine, or accept the proposal. Acceptance produces an editable implementation plan. Execution requires a separate approval. A local or cloud agent works in an isolated workspace, runs checks, and proposes a patch. A trusted publisher creates a draft PR. GitHub events update its status in the dashboard.

The user can record whether the implemented change helped. Merge and business benefit remain separate facts.

## Release exclusions

V1 does not create new businesses, production domains, customer merchant accounts, advertising campaigns, or social accounts. It does not merge PRs, deploy user repositories, or retrain a model automatically from feedback.

Cross-customer cached analysis, guaranteed Instagram Saved synchronization, full TikTok portability approval, independent self-hosting support, and unrestricted hosted ChatGPT subscription inference are gated follow-on integrations. Their absence must not break the core product or appear as a working marketing promise.

The cloud runner is required for a complete hosted option. Its availability must not be advertised before a real sandbox integration passes testing. A local-only private preview can exist, but it is not the complete paid hosted release.

## Limits and entitlements

The initial tier catalogue is in [Billing and tax](BILLING-AND-TAX.md). Every billable operation presents a quote in processing credits before the user commits. Users can enable bounded automatic analysis of future captures. Code execution always requires an approval in V1.

Uploads are initially limited to 250 MB and 10 minutes per source. Reject over-limit files before expensive processing when metadata is available. Recheck after decoding because supplied duration can be false. A source can contain multiple clips or carousel images, but each asset must fit a documented supported type. Unsupported carousels remain saved links with a clear status.

A user can connect a repository without enabling writes. Generated plans remain useful without an execution provider. Source content can be useful without a repository. These are valid product states, not incomplete onboarding failures.

## Nonfunctional requirements

Private reads and mutations must reject missing or foreign workspace membership. Paid access must come from verified entitlements, never browser-supplied plan names. Replayed notifications and webhooks must not create duplicate work or credits.

The web shell must meet the initial mobile performance budgets in [Dashboard and mobile UX](DASHBOARD-AND-MOBILE-UX.md). Processing latency is measured and displayed. The product must not promise real-time completion while a local computer is asleep or a provider queue is full.

The system must recover a queued job without repeating already committed side effects. It must distinguish provider refusal, unavailable content, low-confidence extraction, budget exhaustion, and internal failure.

No user code runs in the web application process or database backend. No GitHub write token enters the media decoder or reasoning prompt. All execution secrets have narrow scope and short lifetime.

## Success measures

The primary activation event is a user reviewing the first evidence-backed proposal for a selected project. An import alone is not activation.

The product tracks useful-proposal rate, accepted-plan rate, PR merge rate, confirmed-benefit rate, time to first review, processing failure rate, cost per processed minute, and contribution margin. Definitions and denominators are in [Feedback and evaluation](FEEDBACK-AND-EVALUATION.md).

The initial launch benchmark uses at least 40 rights-cleared test clips and two repositories with known expected outcomes. It includes code on screen, accents, music, misleading advice, already-implemented ideas, and no-fit cases. A benchmark report is required before advertising accuracy.

## Definition of done

A new user can subscribe through tested billing, import a permitted sample, read the summary on a phone, understand its relevance to a selected repository, approve a plan, execute it through an authorized runner, and see the resulting PR state after GitHub changes it.

The same journey must handle an unavailable source, insufficient credits, a disconnected provider, an offline laptop, a failed test, a closed-unmerged PR, and a workspace deletion without misleading states or cross-workspace exposure.

The website must describe the actual enabled capabilities. Required legal and production gates must have recorded evidence. Passing a mock-only test suite is insufficient.

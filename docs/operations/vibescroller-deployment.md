# Deploy VibeScroller

Mode: how-to. Current host: Vercel Pro, checked October 2, 2026. Older Netlify and Worker deployments are historical; follow this procedure for the serving application.

## Current production setup

- Repository: `StefanDG1/vibe-scroller`, production branch `main`.
- Vercel project: [vibe-scroller](https://vercel.com/stefandg1s-projects/vibe-scroller), root `apps/starter`, shared workspace files included, Node 24, pnpm 12.3.4 and Frankfurt functions.
- Public domain: `https://scroll.companynerve.com`. Namecheap retains parent DNS and mail; only scroll points to Vercel's verified target `a987f11417c888aa.vercel-dns-017.com.`.
- Convex production: `bold-lemur-667`. Dedicated development: `resolute-ladybug-999`.
- WorkOS production callback: `https://scroll.companynerve.com/callback`. The cookie is `__Host-vibescroller-production`, Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite Lax and host-bound.
- Private R2 uses the explicit EU-jurisdiction endpoint with public bucket access disabled. Production server credentials stay in Vercel and Convex stores. The legacy bucket name does not make its contents public or upstream data.

Production secrets are scoped only to Production. Generated deployment URLs and previews require Vercel authentication. Local ChatGPT credentials and runner configurations stay on the paired computer. Never copy production secrets into previews, source, public Next variables or coding tasks.

## Publish an update

1. Use Node 24 and the pinned package manager. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` when the lockfile changes, then `pnpm check`, `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high`, formatting and `git diff --check`.
2. Review the exact staged changes and run a redacted secret scan on their patch. Keep private ZIPs, PDFs, media, diagnostics, keys, environment files and runner configurations ignored. Preserve failed/skipped checks in [the implementation record](../implementation-status.md).
3. For backend changes, confirm the selected project and deployment, then run `pnpm exec convex deploy --yes` against the dedicated production deployment. Development codegen is not a production deployment. Review schema compatibility and preserve active jobs and ledgers.
4. Commit and push reviewed source to main. The connected Vercel project builds and deploys on Linux using a fixed Basic machine and normal queued concurrency. Documentation-only updates may skip deployment, comparing against the last successful application build; application, policy and unknown changes still build. See [ADR 033](../adr/033-basic-builds-and-documentation-skips.md). Do not deploy a partial Windows adapter package or weaken its security to fix Windows symlink packaging.
5. Confirm required GitHub CI, the immutable alpha release and Vercel success at the exact commit. Check the Account build version and the real domain, not an old hidden tab. Main updates follow [the versioning policy](../VERSIONING.md).
6. Verify affected authenticated browser journeys, private response headers and relevant failure states. Frontend and backend verification are separate. Record environment, timestamp, commit and result.

Use [Vercel migration and rollback details](vercel-migration.md) for project settings and protection. Restore a known frontend deployment if necessary; that does not reverse database schema changes, running jobs, external PRs, reservations or charges. Reconcile uncertain work separately.

## Personal runner

Use the ignored production runner configuration described in [the personal guide](personal-analysis-runner.md). Start one runner, keep the computer awake, and verify its heartbeat in Connections. No inbound port or uploaded OpenAI OAuth token is needed. Personal audio/vision analysis and authorized coding are separate permissions; the failed Windows coding isolation gate remains closed.

## Billing and publication

The dedicated VibeScroller live Stripe account and its separate Managed Payments sandbox are not the Education account. Verify matching account, key mode, all six subscription prices, both top-ups, portal, signed webhook and the selected route before use. Live checkout remains disabled while the applicable release gates are open. Do not replace Managed Payments with direct billing silently.

The selected launch scope is consumer markets where Stripe assumes applicable indirect-tax compliance. Configure `STRIPE_MANAGED_MARKET=tax_covered` and account/mode-bound `STRIPE_MANAGED_COUNTRY_RULE_PROOF` after verifying the exact versioned Radar condition at 100% traffic, no enabled Allow bypass, and actual sandbox acceptance. Renew within 30 days and after rule or coverage changes. Stripe collects the actual billing address; the app omits an additional country selector. Historical `provider_supported` cannot activate live billing. Direct billing retains its separate policy. See [ADR 035](../adr/035-managed-tax-covered-markets.md).

The owner prohibits a real purchase/refund test. Sandbox cards and signed provider reconciliation provide the available payment evidence; record the omitted live test honestly. The [V1 readiness record](../V1-READINESS.md), [release checklist](../LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md), [policy publication checklist](../../legal/POLICY-IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [accountant handover](operator-tax-and-publication.md) identify remaining work. A healthy production deployment is not paid V1 authorization or evidence of legal review.

# Data model

Mode: reference. Names describe proposed Convex tables and serialized concepts.

## Shared fields

Every tenant-owned record includes `workspaceId`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`. Timestamps use UTC epoch milliseconds internally. Display uses the user's locale and timezone. Identifiers are opaque strings, not sequential customer counts.

Versioned records include `schemaVersion` and an immutable content hash. Public routes must not accept a workspace ID as sufficient authorization. Membership comes from the authenticated identity and is checked against the object's actual workspace.

## Dashboard projections

A `sourceCard` query returns a summary, at most three preview main points, coverage, tags, related repo count, proposal counts, and PR counts. It also returns counts for no-fit, already-implemented, unsupported, and unreviewed matches. The detail query loads the full list.

PR counts use unique provider PR IDs. A source-level `hasMergedChange` is true only when at least one linked PR has a verified merge. The UI says "1 merged PR" rather than implying that every idea from the video shipped.

A source may have no PR because it was useful for a non-code task. Such an outcome uses `implementationKind=manual_task`, not a fabricated PR record.

## Indexes and retrieval

Create indexes for workspace plus source capture time, workspace plus processing state, repository plus snapshot SHA, proposal plus version, run plus lease generation, and provider plus webhook ID. Use pagination with stable tie-breakers. Do not load an entire workspace into the browser.

Embedding records include workspace, entity ID, model, dimensions, and content hash. Filter by workspace before returning candidate text. If a vector backend cannot enforce a tenant filter, query through separate tenant partitions or disable it. A filter after exposing results is insufficient.

## Corrections and deletion

Never overwrite raw transcription silently. Store a correction event and update the current projection. A new processing version can replace the current display only with provenance intact.

Deleting a source removes its raw media, transcript, frames, insights, and searchable content. Preserve a minimal redacted link from a historical PR if needed to explain that its source was deleted. Deleting an app record does not silently delete a user's GitHub PR.

Billing and legal-retention records are separated from content. Account deletion explains those exceptions and schedules remaining deletion. The exact statutory retention period comes from the verified operator policy, not a model guess.

## Workspace knowledge records

The implemented extension adds workspace-owned knowledgeTopics, knowledgeMembers, knowledgeJobs, knowledgePolicies, knowledgeEvaluations, issueDrafts and issueAttempts. Source references bind source ID/generation/revision/insight ID. Topic versions preserve corrections; evaluations bind repository SHA/profile version/source-set hash. Old single-source proposals remain unchanged. See [the execution ledger](V1-KNOWLEDGE-EXECUTION.md) for bounds, indexes, migration and acceptance.

## Bounded repository selection

Repository records add optional snapshotPaths and preparationError. Legacy missing scope means the eligible tree. snapshotSummary records selectedPaths, repositoryEligibleFileCount, eligibleFileCount and omittedEligibleFileCount, bound into its cache key. A changed selection uses the existing selectionVersion; unfinished scope changes cannot authorize evidence retrieval or new knowledge evaluations. Confirmed profiles persist. See [ADR 053](adr/053-explicit-bounded-repository-snapshots.md).

knowledgeTopics has a topic-name search index with organizationId/state filters. Renaming updates indexed content through the same versioned mutation; existing records are indexed by Convex without rewriting source or topic data.

## Whole-repository context, October 4

[ADR 054](adr/054-whole-repository-business-context.md) supersedes required scope selection: blank paths discover the complete eligible tree and retain a bounded representative cache. `snapshotSummary.discoveryVersion`, `indexedFileCount` and `businessDocumentPaths` distinguish discovery from inspected content. Whole-mode evidence retrieval uses the pinned complete tree, not the cache as a scope boundary. Internal proposal/plan commit may receive the trusted small inspection manifest. `profileDraftProcessingVersion` fences old context caches; detailed text remains bounded to 8,000 characters and requires human confirmation. Existing corrections, quotes, cost holds, exclusions, tenant/current-access and immutable evidence rules persist. Deployment and actual private-project draft acceptance are recorded separately.

## Bounded library scans and improvement history

Tenant-scoped libraryScans freeze the saved-link cutoff, selected repository snapshot/profile/selection versions, funding, maximum and conservative committed credits. Own-plan grants additionally bind actor/device/model/effort/account hash and expiry. Durable leases and cursors cover every source, knowledge-member and repository-evaluation page; counters distinguish analyzed, skipped, gathered, evaluated, useful drafts and no-fit. The scan references existing analysis, synthesis and evaluation jobs; it does not copy credentials or replace manual membership corrections.

Improvements link current published/reviewed issue bytes, evaluation references and compatible proposals to runs. improvementOutcomes append reported judgment and/or data with deployment context, periods, samples and limitations. improvementPreferences retain private evolving owner context; improvementPolicies bind versioned explicit repository authority and ceilings. Runs optionally retain checks, independent review, durable merge intent and exact-commit provider deployment receipts. Privacy export and tenant/source deletion include the new derived records.

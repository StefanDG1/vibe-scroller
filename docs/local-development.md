# Develop VibeScroller locally

Mode: how-to. Use Node 24 and pnpm 12.3.4 from the repository root. The production application is `apps/starter`; its name reflects the CompanyNerve export. `apps/marketing` remains an inherited build target, while VibeScroller's public routes live in the application.

## Preview without provider accounts

```powershell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
node scripts/setup-preflight.mjs --demo
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3001/demo`. The banner identifies synthetic data. Demo actions do not import media, call AI, charge a payment or write a repository. `/demo?uiState=empty`, `/demo?uiState=loading` and `/demo?uiState=error` expose fixture states. A fixture is not an integration test.

## Configure your own development accounts

1. Run `pnpm convex:dev` and select a new project in your own account. Keep its generated ignored root `.env.local`. Never select the operator's production deployment for development.
2. In your own WorkOS environment enable Magic Auth and Google only. Set callback `http://localhost:3001/callback`, sign-out/homepage `http://localhost:3001` and initiate-login URL `http://localhost:3001/sign-in`. Provision your own Google consent client as described in [authentication](operations/authentication.md).
3. Put that environment's `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` and server-only `WORKOS_API_KEY` in root `.env.local`. Set matching backend values through the provider's secret interface or stdin without printing values. Use `.env.example` for names, never production values.
4. Run `node scripts/setup-preflight.mjs`, then `pnpm setup:local`. Preflight reports names and pass/fail only; setup writes the ignored app environment and preserves its session secret. Restart `pnpm dev` after changes.
5. Sign in with an email code, verify Google separately and confirm sign-out. First sign-in creates a default workspace. Open Library; GitHub and billing are not required to save metadata. Follow [personal setup](PERSONAL-SETUP.md) before enabling analysis or storage.

The helper validates configuration, not provider authentication or commercial access. Do not turn verification flags on to silence an error. Keep `convex:dev` running for backend development and commit generated types without environment values.

## Optional billing tests

Ordinary library setup does not require live Stripe. The catalogue is Starter and Pro with weekly/monthly/annual intervals, not the exported starter's Free/Pro project limit. Use [the billing contract](BILLING-AND-TAX.md) and [provider setup](PROVIDER-SETUP.md) in your own dedicated sandbox. The VibeScroller webhook is `/stripe/v1/webhook` on the Convex HTTP origin. The inherited `/stripe/webhook` is a separate foundation route and does not verify V1 entitlements.

Use the sandbox catalogue utility only with its matching account and mode. Live-price creation and charges require separate operator authorization. Absent billing configuration shows unavailable checkout, never a simulated success. Personal use remains subject to core quotas, explicit reservations and its enabled funding route.

## Verify a change

Run `pnpm check`, `node scripts/audit-dependencies.mjs` and `git diff --check`. Check formatting on changed files. Record browser, integration and secret-scan evidence using [the contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). A build does not prove account-backed setup, Android hardware, a billing settlement or a sandbox boundary.

The original template export command remains provenance, not VibeScroller's personal installer. Independent setup and upgrade evidence must come from clean checkouts and testers' own accounts.

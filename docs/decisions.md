# Product decisions

Mode: reference. These decisions supersede earlier alternatives in the discussion.

## October 7: scoped assistant candidate

[ADR 085](adr/085-scoped-assistant-oauth-and-intake.md) separates official user OAuth from ordinary app identity and requires current, versioned app grants for every assistant operation. Explicit intake reuses capture policy without fetching or spending. Production access remains disabled pending configuration, review and actual supported-client acceptance.

## October 7: bounded Library Explore

[ADR 084](adr/084-bounded-library-explore.md) reuses current cited evidence and recorded outcomes in five bounded Explore views. Owner-private space filters and all-input checks run on the server. Manual layout/alias corrections do not rerun analysis or confer sharing authority. Exact release and independent retrieval/usefulness acceptance remain pending.

## October 7: private filing and setup

[ADR 081](adr/081-private-filing-and-confirmed-setup.md) adds explicit Personal/Business memberships and saved user-stated setup only within the enforced owner-private library. Confirmed combined browsing is distinct from team/assistant grants and funding authority.

## October 7: bounded Home metadata

[ADR 080](adr/080-stable-repository-rename-authority.md) preserves release and backup authority across the authorized GitHub rename using the existing repository's stable ID. Compatibility preparation precedes the external rename; it changes no provider identity or private configuration.

[ADR 079](adr/079-atomic-home-metadata.md) uses atomic metadata triggers and a resumable ten-record backfill for bounded authorized Home reads. Full-content checks, privacy, budgets and approvals remain authoritative. Manual source/category corrections advance timestamp revisions monotonically so same-millisecond edits cannot leave old references current. Actual compact browser and serving recovery acceptance remain separate from local checks.

| D18 | No unlimited AI, no automatic paid fallback, no shared founder subscription                                                                             | Financial and authorization boundary                |
| D19 | Target at least 60% operating margin before company tax, excluding salary, marketing, and development                                                   | Owner-defined metric                                |
| D20 | Under EUR 10 incremental pre-customer spending is a target, not a claim that a new Vercel Pro plan fits                                                 | Budget conflict resolved explicitly                 |
| D21 | Vercel remains supported. Reuse an eligible existing plan if confirmed; otherwise offer the documented budget host profile                              | Deployment policy, no silent vendor switch          |
| D22 | Intended initial tax strategy uses the Romanian small-business exemption when the official record permits it                                            | Recommendation, not verified tax status             |
| D23 | All legal and tax modes are concrete, but production activation needs matching evidence                                                                 | No invented legal facts                             |
| D24 | V2-created businesses use customer-owned service and merchant accounts                                                                                  | Owner's explicit boundary                           |

| D26 | Preserve the exact V2 mode label `full retard mode` internally, with finite permissions and spending                                                    | Owner's requested wording                           |

## Workspace knowledge and issue planning

| ID  | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                          | Basis                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| D28 | Knowledge libraries, connected insights and organization feedback remain separate per workspace. Automatic organization preserves manual corrections.                                             | Owner confirmation October 3; ADR 052 |
| D29 | Users may grant All repositories in GitHub, then explicitly select the active subset through an app checklist. Unselected code and future repositories are not automatically analyzed.            | Owner request October 3; ADR 052      |
| D30 | AI drafts project business context by default for user confirmation/correction. Combined ideas can produce separately reviewed GitHub issues without coding approval; coding/PR approvals remain. | Owner confirmation October 3; ADR 052 |

[The V1 knowledge-library plan](V1-KNOWLEDGE-LIBRARY-PLAN.md) specifies missing implementation and acceptance. These product decisions do not claim that new UI, synthesis or issue publication already exists.

## Current hosting and execution

On October 2, 2026, the owner selected Vercel Pro, withdrew Netlify use and asked to avoid E2B. Vercel Sandbox replaces E2B behind the execution adapter. No new hosting purchase is authorized. Shared included credits do not mean unlimited free execution. [ADR 023](adr/023-vercel-isolated-execution.md) records implementation and verification boundaries.

## Known operator context

The founder uses an Android OnePlus 13 and a Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 2024 with 32 GB RAM and an RTX 4070 laptop GPU. Typical personal input is one to five English videos daily. These are sizing assumptions, not limits on other customers' devices.

The founder reports an existing ChatGPT Pro x5 subscription costing EUR 121 per month. It is an existing personal expense and does not fund shared customer inference. The founder reports a live-ready Stripe account. This package does not independently verify either entitlement.

Company details come from CompanyNerve's published configuration. They require confirmation before legal-page publication. The VAT statements in the conversation conflict. No document resolves that conflict by guessing a registration number or removing an existing registration.

## Explicit nonclaims

The product has not been built by this documentation task. Automatic imports have not been tested against the founder's account. Model accuracy, demand, production unit costs, and margins are not measured. Domain availability, trademark rights, provider commercial approval, tax registration, and legal clearance are not established.

## October 5: bounded full-library scan and personal repository allowance

Follow [ADR 058](adr/058-bounded-full-library-scans.md): full URL-link pagination with a saved cutoff, explicit funding/model/device/effort grant, conservative credit ceiling and current selected confirmed context. Analyze, gather, compare and draft through existing features; do not force no-fit issues or publish automatically. A verified personal-subject repository override may support twenty repositories while normal commercial limits remain unchanged. GPT-6.1 is offered only by a supported safely executing adapter that actually advertises it. Official Codex model/list access alone does not enable the separate paired Responses route. [ADR 057](adr/057-continuous-reviewed-improvements.md) permits an explicitly bounded reviewed routine cycle only after its production acceptance; all protected work and deployment provisioning retain separate approval.

## October 6: personal subscription library imports

[ADR 063](adr/063-personal-local-library-imports.md) extends the allowlisted operator's isolated own-account session to the explicitly approved four-hour saved-library run. Local preparation/offline transcription and official-client GPT-6.1 Sol Medium outputs may enter canonical private sources, topic summaries and current-code repository evaluations after independent validation. No paid fallback, subscription pooling, reset-credit use or automatic issue publication is authorized. Current source/rights/membership/version fences, corrections, exclusions, deletion and exact external review remain mandatory.

## October 6: useful topic discovery

[ADR 065](adr/065-populated-topic-ordering.md) orders the default paginated workspace library by owner pins and included insight count. Empty and legacy topics remain accessible; inferred volume is not evidence quality. Search, filtering, access, corrections and processing limits remain unchanged.

## October 6: confirmed project evidence

[ADR 066](adr/066-confirmed-project-evidence.md) prioritizes safe current implementation paths named in confirmed context during personal knowledge evaluation. The immutable manifest, current authorization and all inspection limits remain enforced. A new local inspection key preserves earlier incomplete-context results without reusing them as corrected evidence.

## October 6: recovered caption evidence

[ADR 064](adr/064-local-caption-evidence.md) corrects a real omitted-caption input path. Reuse the bounded pinned acquisition manifest for personal source imports, cite recovered captions, preserve titles/corrections, and clear temporary metadata under existing privacy boundaries. Source-only metadata or truncated titles cannot establish missing media claims.

## October 6: insight-first repository retrieval

[ADR 067](adr/067-insight-first-knowledge-retrieval.md) preserves saved-idea terms before a detailed confirmed profile fills bounded file/window ranking. Personal and managed evaluations share the builder and existing knowledge inspection limits. Historical outcomes remain recorded; actual gaps and useful research proposals require separate current evidence.

## October 6: temporary subscription session cleanup

[ADR 068](adr/068-subscription-session-expiry-cleanup.md) keeps controller cleanup alive after the sign-in client closes and stops the worker and proxy at one fixed approved deadline. The observed expired-container failure remains recorded. No credential retention, expiry extension or paid fallback is authorized.

[ADR 069](adr/069-release-completed-subscription-client.md) releases the completed sign-in client's threads and uses an init process to reap orphaned children within the unchanged isolated worker limits. Connection failures and bounded recovery attempts remain recorded.

[ADR 070](adr/070-untimed-image-evidence-labels.md) labels demonstrated untimed carousel evidence as numbered images rather than implying a video timeline. Source references, corrections and asset access remain unchanged.

## October 7: VibeScroll direction and complete insight review

[ADR 075](adr/075-vibescroll-product-direction.md) records the owner-selected VibeScroll name, original always-present Scroll character, dashboard, Personal/Business knowledge views, useful first-post onboarding and scoped assistant connection. The [evolution plan](VIBESCROLL-EVOLUTION-PLAN.md) now incorporates the complete captured insight review and retains original V1 acceptance. This is a planning/documentation update only. Rename, implementation, public campaigns, new funding or broader permissions are not executed or implied.

[ADR 076](adr/076-persuasive-design-and-analysis-references.md) refines that plan with owner-approved pricing anchors, restrained CTA shimmer, genuine unfinished loops and conditional persuasive techniques. Saved-post citations open authenticated VibeScroll analyses. Current onboarding keeps one real result before payment; the earlier-payment A/B investigation is future work outside this plan. Prices, permissions, funding and production behavior remain unchanged.

[ADR 077](adr/077-optional-vibescroll-local-workspace.md) allows implementation in the current checkout or a new `C:\Code\VibeScroll` root, with verified backup, preserved local/private work and deliberate setup updates. It supersedes the earlier single-path restriction without authorizing unrelated work or replacement infrastructure. Prepare feasible login/MFA/consent actions at the start; later action-specific approvals remain enforced. No directory move is performed by this documentation update.

## October 7: explicit exact-version team knowledge sharing

[ADR 082](adr/082-exact-version-team-knowledge-grants.md) separates expiring team grants from owner-private filing and combined browsing. Exact current sources, target workspace, recent sign-in and grant version are enforced outside the model. No mixed derived content, original evidence, assistant grant, funding or publication authority follows. Actual two-account acceptance remains a separate gate.

## October 7: resumable bounded evidence backups

[ADR 083](adr/083-resumable-bounded-evidence-backups.md) adds an operator-only encrypted checkpoint and bounded parts while preserving existing per-object and batch/restore limits, fresh deletion/generation guards and seven-day retention. Local regression checks do not establish a full retained-object backup or serving restoration.

## October 7: exact project context and private assistant suggestions

[ADR 087](adr/087-exact-project-context-assistant-drafts.md) makes confirmed library context and exact project context separate explicit choices. Private assistant suggestions reuse current canonical evaluations and existing private drafts, preserving manual edits and distinct non-fit judgments. They grant no spending, publication or coding authority. Real OAuth and host acceptance remain separate gates.

## October 7: persistent scoped completion Events

[ADR 088](adr/088-persistent-scoped-completion-events.md) adds finite renewable source-status webhooks through the actual modern MCP SDK. Callback verification, connection-time public-address checks, encrypted purpose-bound authority, current provider/app checks, durable receipts, bounded retry and recovery quarantine are required. HTTP receipt remains separate from host processing. Activation and real supported-host acceptance remain gated.

## October 7: current and future assistant library scopes

[ADR 090](adr/090-current-and-future-assistant-library-scopes.md) implements the owner-requested Off, Personal, Business or Both choice, including future eligible posts. Legacy exact-post grants are not expanded automatically. Current rights, filing, tenancy, expiry and revocation remain enforced; exact team/coding approvals are unchanged. Bounded indexed retrieval and a dedicated Connections slice avoid whole-library setup reads and background polling. Actual host acceptance remains separate.

## October 7: readable bounded Usage

[ADR 091](adr/091-readable-bounded-usage.md) replaces raw Usage JSON with actual allowance, retained holds and bounded settled credit entries. The existing authorized two-query slice omits unrelated private records. Revoked and expired allowance cannot contribute to availability; unknown holds, funding and approval boundaries remain unchanged. Request/transfer evidence is separate from database billing and production acceptance.

## October 8: honest shared evidence labels

[ADR 092](adr/092-honest-shared-evidence-labels.md) preserves untimed shared citations without inventing a video timestamp and labels the shared route correctly. Permissions, exact-version grants, pagination and budgets remain unchanged.

## October 8: visual library and dashboard

[ADR 093](adr/093-visual-library-and-dashboard.md) adopts the owner-requested circular network, saved-parent branching diagram and real loaded-record dashboard charts. Graph lines preserve provenance; counts state their cohorts and browsing starts no inference. Exact acceptance and deployment evidence remain separately recorded.

## October 8: owner-selected vertical atlas and five mobile actions

[ADR 094](adr/094-vertical-library-and-project-trail-direction.md) records design 2 for Library, design 3 for Projects, rejection of the collection desk and the future Home/Library/Save/Projects/Account mobile structure. The [draft UI and UX plan](design/VIBESCROLL-UI-UX-PLAN-20261008.md) records confirmed overview-first/remembered-position and device-theme defaults, with composition still pending. This is a planning decision, not implementation or a production design contract.

## October 9: implement the selected atlas

[ADR 095](adr/095-atlas-shell-and-bounded-visual-workflows.md) and the [implementation contract](design/ATLAS-IMPLEMENTATION-CONTRACT-20261009.md) record the owner's authorization to implement the branching Tree and expanded Folders views, five mobile actions, device theme, real project trails and restrained motion. The implementation candidate preserves all existing authority and budgets; release evidence remains separate.
